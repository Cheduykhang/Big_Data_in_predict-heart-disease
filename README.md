# Big_Data_in_predict-heart-disease
Use PySpark, Hadoop, Machine Learning (Random Forest) for predict heart disease

Given a medical dataset containing demographic information (age, gender) and biometric indicators (blood pressure, cholesterol, heart rate, etc.) of patients, the problem requires:

Input Identification:
   - A dataset containing patient information in tabular form.
   - The target variable is a classification label (target), where 1 indicates a patient at risk of heart disease, and 0 indicates no risk.

Output Identification:
   - A predictive model based on Machine Learning algorithms that accurately classifies patients at risk of heart disease based on input data.

Constraints and Requirements:
   - The data must be preprocessed and cleaned before model development (e.g., handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature normalization).
   - The model must be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure effectiveness.

Problem Objectives:
   - Accurately predict the risk of heart disease based on medical data.
   - Analyze and identify key factors influencing heart disease (e.g., blood pressure, heart rate).
   - Optimize algorithms to achieve high accuracy and effectively apply machine learning in medical data analysis.
